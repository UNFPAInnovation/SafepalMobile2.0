If you have been raped and think you do not want to report it, you could report it later and having the medical exam results can help you.</item>
        <item>Even if you do not get examined right away, you can still get a checkup later. It is always best to see a doctor immediately after a rape. But a person can still go to a doctor or local clinic to get checked out for STIs, pregnancy, or injuries any time after being raped.</item>
